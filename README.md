Text-to-Speech for Arduino

The original implementation was by Clive Webster in Webbotlib 
(http://webbot.org.uk/iPoint/30.page ).

This was ported to Arduino by Gabriel Petrut
(http://www.tehnorama.ro/minieric-modulul-de-control-si-sinteza-vocala/ ).

Stephen Crane modified it to use pins other than pin 10.
